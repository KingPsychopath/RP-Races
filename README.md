RP-Races for Minecraft. Idea http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/races-species-plugin.138526/

My First Plugin
So bear with me!


What I got so far

The Commands are working (except the time one)

You can sucsessfully select a race

The race will be stored in a flatfile



What is still to do:

Nice formatet text for the commands (like help)

The Abilities

the abilitie to create your own class

(and out of that follows)

the ability to make your own abilities

And then a cleanup of the code. Right now it's a mess o.o
